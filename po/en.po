"The game is played by two players on opposing corners of the board. The goal "
"of the game is to transfer all of one's pieces from one's own camp into the "
"camp in the opposing corner. Each turn, a player either moves a single piece "
"to an adjacent open square, or jumps over one or more his or opponent's "
"pieces in sequence. A player who reached the camp in opposing corner faster "
"wins."
